# Smart Thermostat

A short exercise to demonstrate machine learning concepts with the example of training a smart thermostat.

There are two files, one for the student to complete and a completed one for reference.

You will need the following:

- Python
- matplotlib
- sklearn

If you are using [Python anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com), you will need to install sklearn before running this. To do so [(general instructions here)](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/InstallingNewModules/), open a console, then run `pip3.7 install --user sklearn`. If you are using a different version of Python to 3.7, change the pip command.
